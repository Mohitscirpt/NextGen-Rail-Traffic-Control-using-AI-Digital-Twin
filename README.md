AI-Powered Train Traffic Control System
📌 Overview

Indian Railways currently relies on manual traffic controllers to manage train movements. With increasing congestion, mixed train priorities, and real-time disruptions, this manual system faces delays, inefficiency, and safety risks.

Our project aims to build an AI-powered Intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) that helps controllers make real-time, optimized decisions for train routing, precedence, and rescheduling.

🎯 Problem Statement

Manual decision-making is slow and error-prone.

Network congestion and operational complexity are growing.

Limited infrastructure must be shared by multiple trains (passenger, freight, express).

Real-time disruptions (delays, breakdowns, weather) complicate scheduling.

🧠 Proposed Solution

An AI + Optimization-based system that:

Collects real-time data (GPS, signaling, timetables, weather).

Predicts delays and detects conflicts.

Uses optimization algorithms (AI + OR) to suggest best routing and rescheduling.

Provides a controller dashboard with recommendations and override capability.

Supports digital twin simulation for testing "what-if" scenarios.

🔑 Features

✅ Real-time train tracking & delay prediction

✅ Conflict & collision detection

✅ Dynamic rescheduling & rerouting

✅ Passenger information transparency

✅ Controller-friendly dashboard

✅ Scalable for 1000+ trains per day

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend/AI: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OR-Tools

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Frontend: React.js (map-based UI)

Deployment: Flask / Django APIs

Data Sources: Train schedules, GPS feeds, signaling data, weather APIs
